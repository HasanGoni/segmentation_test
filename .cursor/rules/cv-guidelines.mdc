# Specialized Grayscale Image Processing Guidelines

## Data Preprocessing for Scientific/Industrial Images
- Normalize single-channel images: `mean=[0.485], std=[0.229]` or use domain-specific statistics
- Use appropriate bit-depth handling (8-bit, 12-bit, 16-bit images)
- Implement proper contrast enhancement techniques:
  - Adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE)
  - Gamma correction
  - Min-max normalization
- Handle noise characteristics specific to imaging modality:
  - Salt-and-pepper noise for X-ray
  - Gaussian noise for microscopy
  - Specular reflections for semiconductor inspection

## Model Architecture Considerations
- Input channels should be 1 for grayscale
- Consider using larger initial filter sizes (7x7 or 9x9) for capturing fine details
- Implement multi-scale analysis for varying feature sizes
- Use appropriate padding for border regions (important for defect detection)

## Task-Specific Guidelines

### X-ray Image Processing
- Implement proper exposure normalization
- Handle varying contrast levels
- Consider metal artifact reduction techniques
- Use appropriate windowing functions

### Microscopic Image Analysis
- Handle varying illumination conditions
- Implement scale-invariant feature detection
- Consider phase contrast enhancement
- Handle out-of-focus regions

### Semiconductor Inspection
- Implement proper alignment procedures
- Handle reflective surface artifacts
- Consider multi-angle lighting conditions
- Implement die-to-die comparison techniques

## Visualization and Quality Control
- Use appropriate grayscale colormaps (avoid rainbow colormaps)
- Implement proper contrast stretching for display
- Use appropriate bit-depth for saving results
- Consider domain-specific visualization needs:
  - False coloring for feature emphasis
  - Overlay capabilities for annotations
  - Side-by-side comparison views
